Spot weld machine is used to spot weld the lithium-ion and lithum-ferro-phosphate cells in series and parallel to produce a battery.
this code is written for the machine to accurately spot weld the cells.

I have used two stepper motors for X and Y axes.

TB6600 drivers are used to control the motors and are programmed
Arduino mega microcontroller is used to control the work process.

This project contains various electrical and electronic components that are controlled by the microcontroller , which includes relays,
limit-switches,sensors,emergency switch , led , etc.
